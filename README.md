# Malware-Detection-Mitigation
"A project focused on detecting and mitigating malware using advanced machine learning algorithms, enhancing cybersecurity by identifying and neutralizing potential threats. It includes a comprehensive analysis and implementation of various detection techniques and mitigation strategies."

## Overview
This repository contains an AI-driven malware detection and mitigation application. The app leverages machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks to identify and neutralize malicious software effectively.

## Features
1: Data Loading and Preprocessing: Efficiently loads and preprocesses large datasets.<br>
2: Model Training and Evaluation: Implements Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks for malware detection.<br>
3: Visualization: Provides confusion matrices and other visual aids for model evaluation.<br>
4: Mitigation Strategies: Applies predefined actions to mitigate detected malware.<br>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.7.6
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection-mitigation.git
   cd malware-detection-mitigation
   ```
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run the application
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   
## Usage
1. Load Dataset: Load your dataset in CSV format.
2. Preprocess Data: The application will automatically preprocess the data by removing unnecessary columns.
3. Train Models: Train the implemented machine learning models.
4. Evaluate Models: Evaluate the performance of the models using accuracy and confusion matrices.
5. Detect and Mitigate Malware: Use the trained models to detect malware and apply mitigation measures.

## Mitigation Actions
* Quarantine the infected file or system.
* Disconnect the affected system from the network.
* Notify the security team.
* Perform a deep scan using antivirus software.
* Analyze the malware for further insights.
* Remove or neutralize the malware.

## Visualization
The application provides visual representations of the confusion matrices for better understanding and analysis of the model performances.
